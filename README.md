# Node.JS (Express) OIDC Integration

This is an integration sample written in JavaScript using the [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) runtime and the [express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework. The core logic of this application is at the [index.js](https://github.com/loginid1/nodejs-express-integration/blob/master/index.js). There you will find the setup logic for [passport-oauth2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-oauth2) and the flow for making login calls and the setup for the callback endpoint.

## Requirements

- `Node.JS`
- `Git`

## Local setup

To run this project locally in your development environment, you will have to use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. For this project, we are using `localhost` URI.

**Optional configuration:**

If you are running multiple projects, consider accessing the `hosts` file to add a custom URI setting for your project.

**Linux and macOS:** `/etc/hosts`

**Windows:** `C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`

The `hosts` file will look like the following:
```
# Default Settings
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost

# Custom URI Settings
127.0.0.1       node.integration.localhost
```

**Note:** When using a custom URIs for your local projects, you will have to use `.localhost` suffix.

#### Clone the project

The first step to getting this project up and running is to clone this repository. Once you cloned the project, you will need to `cd` into the project folder.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/loginid1/nodejs-express-integration.git
$ cd nodejs-express-integration
```
#### Install dependencies

This project utilizes [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage its dependencies. So, before using this project, make sure you have npm installed on your machine.

```
$ npm install
```

#### Fill the environment variables

To configure environment variables you will need make a copy of `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` and fill all the environment variables. To have a better understanding of the variables please refer to this [section](#filling-the-environment-variables).

```
$ cp .env.example .env
```

#### Execute the project

```
$ npm run start
```

Or run the project with a watcher 

```
$ npm run dev
```

## Filling the environment variables

#### The `LOGIN_URI` variable

This is the URI that will be used to communicate with LoginID's servers.

```
LOGIN_URI=https://oauth2.usw1.loginid.io
```

#### The `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URI` variable

When the user authenticates themselves with LoginID (similar to authenticating with Google), LoginID will need to pass back control and information back to your servers. The Callback URL is the path that will be used to accomplish this and you will need to define it.

```
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/callback
```

**Note:** Save this redirect URI, you will use it to create your client credentials later on. 

#### The `LOGIN_SCOPES` variable

Add the `openid` scope to have access to the JWT. If you need access to the refresh token also add the `offline` scope.

```
LOGIN_SCOPES=openid
```

#### The `LOGIN_APPID` and `LOGIN_APPSECRET` variables

In order to receive access to integrate LoginID, you will need to create your client credentials. This is similar to the credentials you would create with Google to use Google authentication. This allows you to use LoginID services in a secure, authenticated fashion.

To obtain the client keys you will need to perform the following steps:

**Step 1** - Using an existing account or registering a new one

 - Navigate to https://usw1.loginid.io/en/register
 - Enter your username and organization id for an existing account or select the **"Sign Up"** option and create a new account.
 - Hit the **"Login"** or **"Register"** button

**Step 2** - Use your biometric capabilities

 - Your web browser will ask for permission to use your security key or another authenticator in order to proceed with account creation.
 - Please note that the native dialogues for doing so vary by browser, operating system and the type of authenticator you are using. 

**Step 3** - Enter the integration dashboard

Once you have access to the LoginID dashboard, use the navigation bar to select **"Integrations"** option or press the **"Add Integration"** button.

**Step 4** - Sign the Customer License Agreement

 - Scroll down the page and press the **"View"** button.
 - Agree to the terms and press the **"Sign"** button.

**Step 5** - Add new OIDC Integration
 
 - Press the **"Get Integrated"** button under the OIDC box.
 - Enter a name for your application, website or service.
 - Enter the callback URL for your application, website or service.
 - Press the **"Create"** button.
 - Copy the Application ID and Application Secret and use them to fill the `LOGIN_APPID` and `LOGIN_APPSECRET` variables respectively.

```
LOGIN_APPID=your.application.id
LOGIN_APPSECRET=your.application.secret
```
